Audio Sync Concept

-Software to synchronize audio output across multiple devices on a network
    -Example: Playing music throughout a home wirelessly via the many devices scattered throughout the building
-Does not use Bluetooth, as Bluetooth massively redeces quality of audio
-Multiple clients connect to a single host machine
    -Each client asks host for synchronization details
    -Host calculates delays based on responses from clients
    -Host adjusts synchronization for clients as necessary
-Host is able to stop and resume broadcasting at will
    -Host possibly able to broadcast from multiple audio sources
        -Example: user sends audio into microphone, which host broadcasts to clients.
    -Volume adjustment is done client-side
-Host pings clients every x ms, often enough so that adjustments to synchronization are not noticed by user
-Uses UDP protocol (packets are sent without confirmation or retransmission) so that momentary lapses in connection do not result in garbled audio
-If synchronization component runtime is too high, implement a queue method and/or optimize ping and comparison algorithm
